This project is for a demo of "XML and Perl" for SVPerl, the Silicon Valley
Perl user group, in Sunnyvale, CA, USA.

It showcases three of the major XML handling options:
* XML::Simple
* XML::XPath
* XML::LibXML

It uses these modules to parse sample Medline data from PubMed into objects.

I chose to use the "2012 Production Year Data" in the 2012 NLMMedlineCitationSet DTD
from http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/sample_records_avail.html . This data is
freely available and representative of large-scale data in XML form. The
sample data in this project is taken from that dataset and is, I believe,
copyrighted by the US National Library of Medicine.

This package is Copyright 2012 by Michael Friedman, known online as "frimicc".
